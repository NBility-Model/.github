# How to Contribute

## Collaboration - _Feature branches_

Archi provides the possibility for users to collaborate for modeling and working on the same repository. 
Depending on the need, multiple feature branches may be created. See this article on how to create a feature branch _(Put hyperlink)_. Each user with the appropriate permission can create a feature branch from the main branch and provide permission to other users who will work on this feature branch. 
These feature branches exist parallel to the main branches. Users can make changes and commit them to feature branches. They are them visible to all other users. 
Feature branches provide an effective way for collaboration. Users can work on various aspects of an architecture model and share the progress with each other for review and comments without changing or affecting the main repository. 
Once a feature or change has been reviewed and accepted, the feature branch can be merged with the main repository. By doing so, the changes in the feature branch committed to the main branch. 

## Overview of collaboration

After opening Archi, from the menu, choose _Collaboration_ and then click _Toggle collaboration_. This will open the collaboration workspace showing all repositories where multiple users are collaborating. Clicking on a repository will show all feature branches and the users who created these branches, see Figure 1 below.

## Consistency in commits to main branch

It would occur that users while working on their own branches makes changes which are conflicting. Provide example. For such cases Archi has a conflict resolution mechanism wherein for every conflicting change, the user is asked to specify change in the model he/she would like to keep, and which changes can be omitted. By doing so, consistency is ensured in the main architecture repository. 

Contributions for contributors should be submitted as Github pull requests. See [Creating a pull request]([https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request](https://github.com/NBility-Model/.github/blob/main/images/Fig%201%20Collaboration.png)) if you're unfamiliar with this concept.
