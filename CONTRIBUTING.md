# Contributing to NBility-Model
Thank you for considering contributing to the NBility-Model project! We appreciate your interest and look forward to your contributions. Follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth and collaborative experience.

## How to Contribute
### Collaboration - Feature Branches
NBility-Model provides the possibility for users to collaborate on modeling and working on the same repository. Depending on the need, multiple feature branches may be created. See this article on how to create a feature branch. Each user with the appropriate permissions can create a feature branch from the main branch and provide permission to other users who will work on this feature branch.

Feature branches exist parallel to the main branches. Users can make changes and commit them to feature branches. They are then visible to all other users. Feature branches provide an effective way for collaboration. Users can work on various aspects of an architecture model and share the progress with each other for review and comments without changing or affecting the main repository.

Once a feature or change has been reviewed and accepted, the feature branch can be merged with the main repository. By doing so, the changes in the feature branch are committed to the main branch.

### Overview of Collaboration
After opening Archi, from the menu, choose _Collaboration and then click _Toggle collaboration. This will open the collaboration workspace showing all repositories where multiple users are collaborating. Clicking on a repository will show all feature branches and the users who created these branches, as shown in Figure 1 below.

### Consistency in Commits to Main Branch
It might occur that users, while working on their own branches, make changes that conflict. For such cases, Archi has a conflict resolution mechanism wherein for every conflicting change, the user is asked to specify the change in the model they would like to keep, and which changes can be omitted. By doing so, consistency is ensured in the main architecture repository.
