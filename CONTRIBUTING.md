# Contributing to NBility-Model
Thank you for considering contributing to the NBility-Model project! We appreciate your interest and look forward to your contributions. Follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth and collaborative experience.

## Ways of Contributing
Contribution does not necessarily mean committing code to the repository. We recognize different levels of contributions, as shown below in increasing order of dedication:

1. **Testing and Feedback**
* Test and use the model.
* Provide feedback on the user experience.
* Suggest new features.
2. **Validation**
* Validate the model against your use-cases.
* Share your feedback and experiences.
3. **Bug Reporting**
* Identify and report bugs.
* Provide detailed information to help us replicate and fix issues.
4.  **Documentation Improvement**
* Enhance existing documentation.
* Add new documentation to clarify and improve understanding.
5. **Model Development**
* Feature Enhancements: Improve or add new features to the NBility codebase.

### Getting Started
A good place to start is to look at issues with the good first issue label, or to check the [NBility-Model project](https://github.com/orgs/NBility-Model/projects/3/views/1). These are beginner-friendly issues that are well-suited for new contributors.

## Using the NBility Model Project Planning Board
The [NBility-Model project Planning Board](https://github.com/orgs/NBility-Model/projects/3/views/1) is an essential tool for organizing and tracking the progress of tasks within the NBility-Model project. Here's how to use it effectively:

1. **Accessing the Board**
* Navigate to the project's GitHub Planning Board to view all tasks and their statuses.
  
2. **Understanding Columns**
* The board is divided into columns, each representing different stages of the workflow (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done).
* Tasks move from left to right as they progress through these stages.

3. **Creating and Assigning Tasks**

* New tasks can be created by clicking the "New Issue" button. Provide a clear title and detailed description.
* Assign tasks to yourself or others by using the assignee feature.

4. **Tracking Progress**

* Update the status of tasks by dragging them to the appropriate column.
* Use labels to categorize tasks by type (e.g., bug, feature, documentation).

5. **Collaborating and Communicating**

* Comment on tasks to provide updates or ask for help.
* Mention team members using @username to notify them of important updates.
  
## Example Workflow
1. **Backlog:** New ideas and tasks are added here.
2. **To Do:** Tasks that are ready to be worked on.
3. **In Progress:** Tasks currently being worked on.
4. **Review:** Completed tasks awaiting review.
5. **Done:** Completed and reviewed tasks.
   
Using the planning board helps keep the project organized, ensures transparency, and facilitates collaboration among contributors.

## How to Contribute to the Model
### Collaboration - Feature Branches
NBility-Model provides the possibility for users to collaborate on modeling and working on the same repository. Depending on the need, multiple feature branches may be created. See this article on how to create a feature branch. Each user with the appropriate permissions can create a feature branch from the main branch and provide permission to other users who will work on this feature branch.

Feature branches exist parallel to the main branches. Users can make changes and commit them to feature branches. They are then visible to all other users. Feature branches provide an effective way for collaboration. Users can work on various aspects of an architecture model and share the progress with each other for review and comments without changing or affecting the main repository.

### Overview of Collaboration
After opening [Archi]](https://www.archimatetool.com/), from the menu, choose _Collaboration and then click _Toggle collaboration. This will open the collaboration workspace showing all repositories where multiple users are collaborating. Clicking on a repository will show all feature branches and the users who created these branches, as shown in Figure 1 below.

### Consistency in Commits to Main Branch
It might occur that users, while working on their own branches, make changes that conflict. For such cases, Archi has a conflict resolution mechanism wherein for every conflicting change, the user is asked to specify the change in the model they would like to keep, and which changes can be omitted. By doing so, consistency is ensured in the main architecture repository.

### Submitting Contributions
Contributions for contributors should be submitted as GitHub pull requests. See [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) if you're unfamiliar with this concept. When submitting a pull request, please ensure:

* Your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
* You have tested your changes thoroughly.
* You have updated any relevant documentation.

Once the Pull Request has been reviewed and accepted, the feature branch can be merged with the main repository. By doing so, the changes in the feature branch are committed to the main branch.

## Getting Help
If you need help or have any questions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub, and we'll do our best to assist you.

We appreciate your contributions and efforts in making NBility-Model better!

Happy coding!
